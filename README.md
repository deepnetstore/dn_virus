The Game:
This simple game uses the ESP-NOW protocol to transmit a basic set of data, including a random integer value and the health level of the broadcasting unit. It is designed as an oversimplified model of biological virus transmission.

Here's how it works:

Broadcasting:  
Each unit transmits data using the ESP-NOW protocol, which only covers a moderate distance.
Data includes a random integer value and the health level of the broadcasting unit.

Game Mechanics:  
When a device receives a broadcast message, it plays a game similar to the classic card game "War".
The broadcasting unit selects a random number within a set range.
The receiving unit, with a slight advantage, selects from a slightly larger range.
Health points are gained or lost based on the game's outcome, randomized within a set range.

Infection Status:  
If a device's health value is 0 or less, it is considered 'infected'.
Health values range from -100 to 100.
The OLED display and LED matrix show the health status. -100 health lights the grid red, while 100 health turns the LEDs green. ðŸ˜Ž

Scoring:  
Points are assigned for specific events and increase continuously, allowing for comparison with other users at the event.
Devices powered on and actively playing the longest have the best chance for high scores.
