# How to upload code to the DN_Virus Badge
#### This project uses PlatformIO

Please follow the guides here [https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation/index.html] to set up PlatformIO.  
We recommend using the VSCode installation method.  

Once PlatformIO is installed, both the code and the file system will need to be built and flashed.  
First build and flash the code, then build and upload the file system.
